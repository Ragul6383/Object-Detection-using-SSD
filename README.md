<h1>ðŸŽ¯ Object Detection using SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)</h1>
<p>
  A computer vision project focused on detecting and classifying objects in real-time using the 
  <strong>SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)</strong> algorithm. This project leverages 
  <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong> for implementing a robust object detection model capable of identifying 
  multiple objects in images and video streams with high accuracy.
</p>

<h2>ðŸŒŸ Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Detection</strong>: Capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time using a single forward pass.</li>
  <li><strong>Pre-trained Models</strong>: Utilizes pre-trained SSD models such as <strong>SSD300</strong> and 
      <strong>SSD512</strong> for efficient object detection.</li>
  <li><strong>Bounding Boxes</strong>: Draws bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores around detected objects.</li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Classes</strong>: Supports detection of multiple classes, including custom object categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: Works with both images and live video feeds from cameras.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸš€ Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong>: Core programming language for model development.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenCV</strong>: For image processing and real-time video capture.</li>
